# TLDR

## Summarizer extension

This is an extension that will summarize text on the web

## To-Do

- [ ] Create the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
  - [ ] Figure out how to create a chrome extension
  - [ ] The Chrome extension must contain a click event that will read whatever text that has been clicked
  - [ ] The chrome extension then will put said text into a box as proof of concept
- [ ] Create a python server that will read the text and then summarize it
  - [ ] The python server will take the text and then summarize it
  - [ ] The python server will then send the summary back to the Chrome extension and then it will display the summary
- [ ] Deployment
  - [ ] Figure out the best place to deploy the server, (maybe gcp)
  - [ ] Figure out if it can be done for free
  - [ ] Figure out how to deploy in chrome extensions
